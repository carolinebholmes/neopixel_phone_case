# NeoPixel Phone Case

This repo contains Team NULL's project for the Capital One Summit for Software Engineers 2015 Hackathon. 

The project was a 3D Printed iPhone 6 case with embedded RGB LEDs notifiying the owner of account transaction activity
as well as budgeting information. The LEDs show a percentage bar of how much of your monthly budget was spent based off
of account data, and displays animations notifying the owner of withdrawals/deposits made to their account before returning
to the budget bar animation.
